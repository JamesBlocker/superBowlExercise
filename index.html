        <h3><a href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/index.html">Eagles Fly</a></h3>
        <p>Reasons to be excited: They've proven they're an elite team that is able to overcome any obstacle, no matter the circumstance. They lost franchise QB Carson Wentz, left tackle Jason Peters, running back Darren Sproles and linebacker Jordan Hicks before him, and still pushed through the NFC to reach the Super Bowl for the third time in franchise history.</p>
        <p>Reasons to be concerned: Well, there's the whole Brady-Belichick thing. They've dominated the league for the past couple of decades, winning five championships. One came against the Eagles after the 2004 regular season. They're going against legends, and doing so without their best player, Wentz.</p>

        <p>Reasons to be excited: Start with familiar faces on the opposite side who played a huge part in the Patriots' Super Bowl win last year -- running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive end Chris Long. They are thought of highly in New England and now to win another Super Bowl, the Patriots will have to stop them. And then consider this angle: When the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years in the 2004 season, they beat the Eagles to do so. Now as they go for a third Super Bowl in four years, it is the Eagles again. Neat storyline. Finally, a Tom Brady vs. Nick Foles quarterback battle favors New England.</p>
        <p>Reasons to be concerned: For those who believe "defense wins championships," this isn't good news for the Patriots. The defenses that have had the greatest success against the Patriots are those that can rush four and get pressure on Brady, while dropping seven into coverage. The Philadelphia defense has shown the ability to do so.</p>
